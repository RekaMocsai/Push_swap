PushSwap

Description
PushSwap is a project that aims to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of instructions. In this implementation, we utilize a combination of binary radix sort and bubble sort to efficiently and effectively sort the given list of integers.

Algorithm
The project utilizes the following algorithmic approach:
Replace the numbers with their corresponding indexes as revealed by the bubble sort algorithm.
Utilize a binary radix sort technique for the sorted indexes to efficiently sort the stack.

Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the code using the provided Makefile.
Run the program with the provided test cases or with your custom inputs.
Instructions
Execute ./push_swap [list of integers] to receive the list of instructions needed to sort the stack.

Optionally, you can use the output of push_swap as input to the checker to verify the sorting.
